# GDP_ANALYSIS_PREDICTION
<p>GDP includes all private and public consumption, government outlays, investments, additions to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreign balance of trade (exports are added, imports are subtracted).</p>

1.To this we have proposed a Project called GDP analysis and Prediction Software system.<br>
2. This system involves the use of various programming techniques, software tools (Python, Datasets, Data Science Model, Data Cleaning Methods, Random forest
regression, Predictive Score Evaluator (r^2 score method, Cross_Score validation method) Sklearn , Pandas) and database management system .<br>
3. It does the various level of authentication calculation and prediction of GDP value, thus reducing the time complexity involved in the conventional method.<br> 
4. All the workis automated so there is no need of paper documentation.<br>
5. We are implementing an application which will predict future GDP values.
