# GDP_ANALYSIS_PREDICTION
GDP includes all private and public consumption, government outlays, investments, additions
to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreign balance of trade (exports are added, imports are subtracted).

!.To this we have proposed a Project called GDP analysis and Prediction Software system.
2. This system involves the use of various programming techniques, software tools (Python, Datasets, Data Science Model, Data Cleaning Methods, Random forest
regression, Predictive Score Evaluator (r^2 score method, Cross_Score validation method) Sklearn , Pandas) and database management system .
3. It does the various level of authentication calculation and prediction of GDP value, thus reducing the time complexity involved in the conventional method. 
4. All the workis automated so there is no need of paper documentation. 
5. We are implementing an application which will predict future GDP values.
